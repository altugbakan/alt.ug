I needed to postpone my [military duty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Turkey) due to working abroad in the Netherlands, so I went to the Turkish Consulate for Turkish citizens living in Eindhoven, in Rotterdam. It is not really documented anywhere that I found, but turns out the Consulate comes to Eindhoven in the weekends once in a while. Since I did not know about that, I took a day off from work and went to Rotterdam by [train](https://www.ns.nl).

## Centraal Station

When I stepped into Rotterdam, (more accurately, when I stepped outside the train station), I was greeted with the amazing architecture of the "Centraal Station", which acted as a trailer of the different architectural styles that I would be seeing.

The letters of "Centraal Station" is the [original letters from the original building in 1957](https://en.rotterdam.info/locations/centraal-station-rotterdam-en/).

## Markthal

I find [Markthal](https://www.markthal.nl) to be the best attraction of Rotterdam, provided how I enjoy eating good food very, very much. There are all kinds of food from all cultures, and the one shop that I found which has really good Turkish food is [The Mantı](https://www.themanti-rotterdam.nl).

Due to the huge artwork on the ceiling by [MVRDV](https://www.mvrdv.com), it is called the [Sistine Chapel of Rotterdam](https://en.rotterdam.info/locations/the-markthal-en/), but I find that a bit overexaggerated.

## Cube houses

Near Markthal, there are unique looking houses which look like cubes.

These houses were built by Piet Blom, who wanted to design [tree-like houses inside a city](https://en.rotterdam.info/locations/cube-houses/). There is one house that is also a [museum](https://www.kubuswoning.nl/en/), so I went inside to see how the houses feel from inside. I only paid €3 for entrance, but I believe it was well worth the price.

The inside is quite spacious with 100m<sup>2</sup> of living space, and the view of the other houses is also nice.

I was wondering if you can actually buy one of these houses, and that's when I saw one that is recently sold!

## Watertaxi

I also _really_ wanted to go on a ride on a [Watertaxi](https://www.watertaxirotterdam.nl), so I booked one and went to the [Euromast](https://euromast.nl/en/). It only costed me €4,50, and it was definitely worth the experience!
