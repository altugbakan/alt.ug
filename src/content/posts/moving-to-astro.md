# Moving to Astro

I've was using [React](https://reactjs.org/) for my website for a while now, but I felt like it was a bit overkill for a simple website like mine. I was looking for something that was a bit more lightweight and easier to use, and also allow me to write my posts in markdown. I found [Astro](https://astro.build/) and it seemed like a good fit for what I was looking for.

## Astro

Astro is a static site generator, which is also pretty fast. Since this website does not actually need a backend, I thought it would be a good fit. I find it important to be able to host my website almost freely, and there seems to be a lot of options for static site hosting. I'm currently using my domain provider's free hosting, for which I only pay for the domain itself.

## Markdown

I've been trying to write in markdown for a while now, and I really like it. It's a lot easier to write in markdown than in HTML, and it's also a lot easier to read. I also like that I can write my posts in my code editor, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and then the posts just magically appear on my website after pushing the newest changes.

## Conclusion

I've been really enjoying Astro for development and the ease-of-use. I'm also looking forward to writing more posts in general, and I'm hoping that Astro will help me with that.
