If you have used [Angular](https://angular.dev) for frontend development, you have definitely dealt with [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev) `Observable`s. These seemingly magic `async` values can be hard to process, especially if you are not experienced with [functional programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functional-programming-paradigm/).

In this post, we will try to process a service that returns an `Observable<number[]>`, and use each of the responses to call two more services to further process our data.

## Modeling the process

We will use [marble diagrams](https://rxjs.dev/guide/operators#marble-diagrams) to model our process. I have used [Swirly](https://swirly.dev) to generate the following diagrams. Please note that exact timing is not that important for our problem, so lines from left to right do not represent the timings accurately.

### Modeling calls

Initially, we will have an observable that emits an array of values. Since a concrete example makes more sense to me, let's make it return the array `[1, 2, 3]`. We will call this function `getValues()`.

<BlogImage src={GetValues} darkSrc={GetValuesDark} alt="Observable that emits an array">
    Our initial observable, which returns an `Observable<number[]>`
</BlogImage>

We also need two processing functions, which both will have `Observable<number>` return values. Let's create a function that doubles the input and one that triples the input. We will call these functions `doubleValue()` and `tripleValue()` respectively.

<BlogImage src={DoubleValue} darkSrc={DoubleValueDark} alt="Function that outputs double of the input as an observable">
    `doubleValue()` function, that doubles the input and returns the output as an `Observable<number>`
</BlogImage>

<BlogImage src={TripleValue} darkSrc={TripleValueDark} alt="Function that outputs triple of the input as an observable">
    `tripleValue()` function, that triples the input and returns the output as an `Observable<number>`
</BlogImage>

Note that these functions do not directly map a value to another. These functions return `Observable`s, which aim to simulate external calls for processing values.

### Modeling overall process

Now, let's put everything together to model the whole process end to end. This will help us get a better overview of how everything will work together.

We need some "magic" functions that can convert our state from one to the other, which are marked with `???`. We first need a way to convert the array to single values, so we can pipe them all together to get two values for each number. Another thing to keep in mind is that `doubleValue()` and `tripleValue()` functions spawn new `Observable`s, so we get an `Observable` of `Observable`s, concisely a "Higher-order `Observable`".

## Finding the magic functions

There are a lot of RxJS [operators](https://rxjs.dev/guide/operators) that may help us process `Observables`. We can flatten, process, or do even more things to help us shape our [pipe](https://rxjs.dev/guide/operators#piping).

### Mapping each value with `map`

[`map`](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/map) operator takes an input `Observable` and maps each value to a different one, similar to the [Array.prototype.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) function. A thing to keep in mind is that the input and the output will both be `Observable`s.

### Flattening values with `mergeAll`

[`mergeAll`](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/mergeAll) operator flattens a higher-order `Observable` into a single `Observable`. But there is also another not well-documented functionality of `mergeAll`, which is flattening an `Observable<T[]>` into `Observable<T>`s. The following marble diagrams will explain these functionalities better.

### Converting an array with `forkJoin`

[`forkJoin`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/forkJoin) function converts an `Observable<T>[]` into an `Observable<T[]>`. It also works similarly with objects as it works with arrays. It is different than `mergeAll`, as it only returns the combination of the latest values as an array or an object.

  src={ForkJoin}
  darkSrc={ForkJoinDark}

</BlogImage>

All three of these are quite important for processing various kinds of `Observable`s. We will use these (and a bonus one) for solving our problem.

## A better model for our process

Now that we know what the magic functions might be, we can create our initial solution for the problem.

<BlogImage
  src={InitialSolution}
  darkSrc={InitialSolutionDark}
  alt="Initial solution of the problem"
>

</BlogImage>

It works! But we aren't yet finished &mdash; we can still do better! Since the `map` and the `mergeAll` functions are used together so frequently, there is another function called `mergeMap` which combines both functionalities. Our final solution now looks like the image below.

Nice and concise! I hope this tutorial helped you be more comfortable with the RxJS operators. Don't forget to check out other operators like [switchMap](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/switchMap), [concatMap](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/concatMap), [exhaustMap](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/exhaustMap) and others.

If you are more into code rather than diagrams, you can check out this [gist](https://gist.github.com/altugbakan/fab95c10ad0164782177fdaaf226aaeb) for the code for this solution. Note that some [tap](https://rxjs.dev/api/operators/tap)s are used for logging the current state without affecting any input or output values. Good luck with handling `Observable`s!
